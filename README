NAME
    Task::BeLike::XAERXESS - Just few modules I use, or like, or both.

SYNOPSIS
      $ cpan Task::BeLike::XAERXESS

DESCRIPTION
    This Task module installs modules I use frequently.

    See "cpanfile" in this distribution for details.

CAVEATS
    *   Dist::Zilla, which has quite many dependencies, is installed in this
        Task and thus installation can possibly last few minutes.

    *   Because Net::SSLeay is installed as one of Dist::Zilla dependencies,
        <OpenSSL> sources are required. On Debian or Ubuntu, you can install
        them using APT via command "sudo apt-get install libssl-dev".
